							  INSTALLATION

Configuration and installation of ptop is easy.  ptop version 3.6
comes with a configure script generated by gnu autoconf.  After
unpacking the tar file, simply run "./configure".  The script will
automatically perform a series of checks on the system and determine
what settings are appropriate for the Makefile and certain include
files.  Once configure completes, simply type "make install" and
ptop will be compiled and installed.  By default, the installation
location is /usr/local/bin.  You can change the destination location
with the --prefix option to configure.

pg_config must be in your path in order to install ptop.

In addition to the standard options, ptop's configure script supports
the following:

    --with-module=name

	Force the use of a particular module.  Modules are located
	in the subdirectory "machine".  A module's name is derived
	from the file's basename without the leading "m_".

    --with-ext=name

	Compile with the extension "name", found in the subdirectory
	"ext". At the present time, there are no extensions in the
	standard distribution.

    --enable-debug
    --disable-debug

	Default off. Include debugging output in the compilation,
	which can be seen with the -D switch.

    --enable-color
    --disable-color

	Default on.  Include code that allows for the use of color
	in the output display.  Use --disable-color if you do not
	want this feature compiled in to the code.  The configure
	script also recognizes the spelling "colour".

    --enable-kill
    --disable-kill

	Default on.  Include code that allows for renicing and sending
	signals to processes from within ptop (the 'kill' and 'renice'
	commands). Use --disable-kill if you do not want this feature
	compiled in to the code.
