If you are having any problems getting pg_top to work, please read the
file "FAQ" *before* contacting me.  Thank you.

pg_top is 'top' for PostgreSQL. It is derived from Unix Top. Similar to top,
pg_top allows you to monitor PostgreSQL processes. It also allows you to:

    * View currently running SQL statement of a process.
    * View query plan of a currently running SELECT statement.
    * View locks held by a process.
    * View user table statistics.
    * View user index statistics.

CAVEAT: version 3 of pg_top has internal commands that kill and renice
processes.  Although I have taken steps to insure that pg_top makes
appropriate checks with these commands, I cannot guarantee that these
internal commands are totally secure.  IF YOU INSTALL pg_top SET-USER-ID
TO ROOT, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK!  I realize that some operating
systems will require pg_top to run setuid root, and I will do everything
I can to make sure that pg_top is a secure setuid program.

To compile and install "pg_top", read the file "INSTALL" and follow the
directions and advice contained therein.

If you make any kind of change to "pg_top" that you feel would be
beneficial to others who use this program, or if you find and fix a bug,
please send me the change.

Be sure to read the FAQ enclosed with the distrubution.  It contains
answers to the most commonly asked questions about the configuration,
installation, and operation of pg_top.
